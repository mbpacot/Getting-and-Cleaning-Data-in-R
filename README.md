# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-in-R
This project is the final requirement in the Coursera course named "Getting and Cleaning Data in R". The main idea to create an R script named "run_Analysis.R" that performs the following data analysis:
1. Download the dataset at https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip  
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
6. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject which is shown in a textfile named "Tidy.txt".
